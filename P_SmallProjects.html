            you play as a drunk guy who got stranded on a rooftop and gained superpowers.
            Use those powers and more to fight your way through the police and make your way to your clothes.

            <!-- General Process -->
            The original vision for this project was a wipeout inspired parkour game with a bunch of obstacles. 
            So I made a fun style mix between 2D & 3D like you can see in the image.
            <br>While iterating I added a cube that could attack the player and found that to be a lot of fun. 
            So I decided to go into a parkour fighting game direction instead.

              <!-- General Process -->
              I gave the player a sword to fight a bunch of enemies that shoot at you & 
              even gave the player overpowered abilities that they could use, with a cooldown. I then released it on

          <h1 class="explanation-subtitle interactivetext">Where it went wrong</h1>
          <p  class="explanation-text">
            During development I never once had anyone playtest it. This led to a lot of tunnel vision. 
            <br><br>
            Because I playtested it so often myself, I hadgotten used to the quircks & subconsiously played around them. 

            When somebody, after completion, finally played it. I noticed that it was really flat. You had your own weapons & powers, so did the police.
            <br><br>
            The whole game was made on brutally killing enemies with style. Although in this form it does succeed in this, it only succeeds 60%.
            <br><br><br><br>

        <div class="textandvideo">
          <div>
            <h1 class="explanation-subtitle interactivetext">How I would continue</h1>
            <p  class="explanation-text">
              It's missing depth, like being able to pick up the police's weapons. 
              There's some depth in the way of f.e throwing your sword, but not enough.
              <br>
              If I were to continue working on this project, I would have to add a lot more depth. More punch, more player feedback. That's where it's lacking.
              In terms of fun, it's according to playtesters still fun.
