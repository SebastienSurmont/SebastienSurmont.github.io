                    I participated in a video game challenge with 6 other developers for $5,000. I ended up narrowly losing first place but decided to keep working on Randy anyway. I plan on releasing the game somewhere in 2025.

With every person you run over, Randy will react to it; every time you crash, he will swear.

                        Unlike my previous games, RTR is a non-linear game. So far, I've managed that by giving NPCs that aren't active in the main storyline some idle dialogue. But I want to add more personality to them, by having them challenge you to a race instead of just talking.

                        Because of the grand scope of the game, I need some solid background systems. The first ones I made were a mission, NPC, and minimap system. All of these systems have to work together seamlessly. For this, I used inheritance. This way, when you make a new mission, you can have an NPC give it to you, which links them. Afterward, it will be marked on the minimap, all managed by the MissionManager.

                    The original idea was a car-based retro driving game based on the competition's "Momentum" theme. Although I have somewhat shifted away from this, I do still plan on keeping this aspect central.

                        Because of a car's limited move-ability compared to a normal character, missions have to be designed differently. That's why I developed unlockable skills like the ability to jump and basically fly using your booster. This way, the base system is not only challenging but also fun & freeing.
