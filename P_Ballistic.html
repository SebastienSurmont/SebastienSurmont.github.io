            <!-- General Process -->
            This is my first game that I'm going to release on steam. Before this I uploaded everything to itch.io.
            Publishing a game on steam brings a whole lot of new challenges and a new bar with it. This is still a work in progress, so
            there's no figures to back the game up. Playtests so far have been very positive, with this being my best game yet.
            <br><br>
            I've made a few videos on this game before, every time with a whole new bunch of skills. This has led to the game being
            restarted multiple times, but I've gotten to a point where I'm ready to complete it.

              <!-- General Process -->
              I've been working on this project off & on for 2 summers now. With plans to finally publish it by the end of this year.
              <br>
              <br>
              This is my first game that I won't release for free on itch.io, which brings a whole lot of challenges with it.

              <!-- General Process -->
              When releasing a free game bugs are not an issue. You also don't have to get super detailed with the design.
              <br>
              Just having 1 solid mechanic is enough. For a big game like this a lot more has to be thought out.
              <br>
              For this project I have to think a lot more about player experience. From game feel to settings.

            <p  class="explanation-text">
              In the first version of this game the level design was very simple. All platforms were on a 2 dimensional plane, going forwards or
              up.
              <br> This limits the amount of levels you can make without introducing new obstacles every time very limited.
              To solve this I had to do a LOT of iteration on the level design.

          <p  class="explanation-text">
            I don't have much to show off yet, since it's still very early.
            But levels will now have walls. Which can have things like shortcuts, tnt & other stuff.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the orginal level design you could only improve your timing & angles, now you can even improve your route.
            Taking inspiration from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8JNhZqzKUc" style="color: rgb(114, 142, 212);" class="clickableLink">minecraft minigame.</a>

            <p  class="explanation-text">
              When playtesting I found that people didn't tend to try and get as fast a time as possible. Until I showed them my score.
              <br>
              
              Which is when the <span class="interactivetext">competitive nature</span>
              that I was trying to appeal to came out. That's why I designed 
              <span class="interactivetext">medals</span>, to give people
              <span class="interactivetext">goals</span> to strive for.

            <p  class="explanation-text">
              One thing I learned from my <a href="P_GameDesign3.html" style="color: rgb(114, 142, 212);" class="clickableLink">Egg Parkour Game</a>
              is the value of coins in platforming games.
              <br><br>They are a great way to give more experienced players 
              <span class="interactivetext">an extra challenge. </span> 
              <br>Thus allowing for greater replayability.

        </div>
        <div class="textandvideo">
          <p  class="explanation-text">
            Unlike my Egg game, lots of coins to collect wouldn't work. Since the goal is to complete the level as fast as possible.
            So every level only has 3 big coins. The perfect amount. Enough to force the player to find new better routes, while
            not being overwhelming in any way.

            <h1 class="explanation-subtitle interactivetext">Marketability</h1>
            <p  class="explanation-text">
              From the start I had to have not just fun, but also marketability in my design. 
              How a game plays is just as important as how it feels when watching a clip of it. 
              <br>
              My experience making games for youtube videos helps a lot with this.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="textandvideo">
          <p  class="explanation-text">
            Marketing a video on youtube is difficult. You're trying to make a game that you can describe
            in a way that will get people to click, with only 60 characters & a static image. 
            <br>After that you've also got to keep people hooked for long enough so they stick around. 
            This is almost exactly the same as with marketing on other platforms.
