            <p  class="explanation-text">
              I had an idea for a cooking game with as many physics as possible.
              <br> The hardest part was balancing the game so that the physics aspect made the game more fun, instead of being frustrating.
              <br>Additionally I had the extra challenge of me wanting to include the Rattatouille movie, 
              meaning I had to incorperate the main character. Remi the rat.

            <!-- General Process -->
            Originally I was going to put Remi on your head, but that would be wasted space on your screen without any added fun. 
            <br> So to still incorperate the rat I instead turned him into an enemy that tries to steal your food. 
            This was huge in terms of gameplay variation.

            <p  class="explanation-text">
              The game also needed an engaging way to complete it, which I did in 2 different ways: reviews & a countdown.
            Either you deliver all the orders in your order list or the timer runs out. 
            Out of the orders 3 random ones will be food critiques, so you don't wanna deliver any burnt food as to not get a bad review.

            <p  class="explanation-text">
              For the cooking mechanic I used Unity's Scriptable Objects, inheritance, polymorphism & MVP. This allowed me to combine
              the logic every food and every cooking utensil would need. 
              <br>
              This allowed me to easily add more utensils & food as needed with little to no added difficulty.
